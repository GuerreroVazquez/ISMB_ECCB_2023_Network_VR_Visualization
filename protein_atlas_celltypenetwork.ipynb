    "Welcome to the \"Network Analysis and Visualization\" notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be introducing basic and advanced layout options for visualizing networks effectively. \n",
    "Another way to improve visualization is to color the nodes in an informative way; in this notebook we will also introduce how to color nodes by communities and node annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following key topics will be covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate a network from expression profile data, perform edge filtering and run a basic layout algorithm to quickly produce content for VR.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Community Detection and Node Coloring: Communities are densely interconnected groups of nodes within a network. We will use a well-known algorithm to assign distinct colors to nodes belonging to the same community. This visualization enhancement helps identify cohesive groups and their relationships within the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Advanced Network Layouts: While the traditional force-directed layout (such as the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm) is commonly used, we will introduce additional layout options that offer different visual perspectives of the network. These layouts can reveal hidden patterns, optimize node placement, or emphasize specific structural characteristics.\n",
